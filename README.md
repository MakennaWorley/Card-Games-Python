# Python Card Games
This project is a collection of Python files designed to simulate various card games. The current implementation includes a working version of Texas Hold'em, and additional games or features may be added in the future.

### Features
Texas Hold'em: A simulation of a Texas Hold'em game.

This code is in the early stages of development and as a side project I started up without much planning on what I want to add. It has been tested for basic functionality but may not handle all edge cases so I need to add more testing. Use it as a learning tool or a starting point for further development, and feel free to contribute improvements.

## How to Play
To start a game of Texas Hold'em, run the texas_holdem.py file from your command line:
```python texas_holdem.py```
